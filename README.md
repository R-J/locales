Locales for Vanilla Forums 
=======

The locales in this repository are periodically generated from the [Vanilla Transifex account](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/vanilla/). They are compatible with all versions of Vanilla Forums since 2.0.18.

To install a locale, simply copy its folder into the `locales` folder in your Vanilla installation. Then go to `Locales` in the Dashboard to enable it. You may also be interested in the [Multilingual addon](https://open.vanillaforums.com/addon/multilingual-plugin).

We changed many locale names in 2014 to discard the country code where it wasn't necessary to simplify translating.

To contribute, please create an account on Transifex.com and request access to a team via the [Vanilla Forums Community Forum](https://open.vanillaforums.com/discussions). We'd love your help!

We [moved our Transifex project](https://open.vanillaforums.com/discussion/28108/vanillas-transifex-moved-rejoin-your-team#latest) in October 2014. This removed all contributors _automatically_. Please rejoin your teams! We apologize for the inconvenience and definitely didn't intend to remove you.

Our contributors have given Vanilla terrific international language support. Thanks for your support!
